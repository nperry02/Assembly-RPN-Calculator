Everything has been correctly implemented to the best of our knowledge

Uses the recomended calling convention:
        umasm urt0.ums calc40.ums printd.ums callmain.ums > calc40.um

Implemented the print module by getting each digit of the number putting 
        the digits into the stack, and then popping them out and printing them

Implemented the value stack by reserving space in segment 0 and having 
        register r2 be a pointer to the top of the value stack

.sections
        urt0.ums:       
                .section init: sets r0 to zero and r2 to be a stack pointer
                .section stk: creates space for the stack
        calc40.ums
                .section rodata: makes space for the jumptable
                .section init: initilizes the jumptable
                .section text: machine code for the commands and 
                waiting-entering loop
        printd.ums
                .section text: machine code for the print command
        callmains.ums
                .section init: holds main
